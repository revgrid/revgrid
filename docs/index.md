# Introduction

Welcome to the Revgrid website

Revgrid is a canvas based virtual grid focusing on realtime data display and performance. Data is injected into the grid using server interfaces.

Its main features are:

* Speed
* Virtual (supporting display of very large data sets)
* Event driven (low CPU usage)
* Multiple selections (rectangle, row and column)
* Focus
* Smooth horizontal scrolling
* Multiple subgrids (header, main, footer)
* Fixed rows and columns
* Plug in cell painters
* Plug in cell editors
* Plug in UI controllers

To use Revgrid, you first need to create a set of servers (implementations of the schema and server interfaces) in order to display data with Revgrid. The test programs in the source code demonstrate how to create these servers. In addition, the Revgrid source code contains 4 pre-built server sets:
1. **Record**: Allows applications to work with records and fields and converts these to rows and columns. Sorting and filtering of rows is fully handled by the server set. In addition, the server set allows recent changes in records and field values to be highlighted in the grid.
1. **Data Row Array**: A data set consisting of an array of JSON objects is injected into Revgrid with a `setData()` function.
1. **Single Heading**: A one row data set where the value of each cell is obtained from a heading field.
1. **Multi Heading**: A data set where the value of each cell is obtained from an array in the heading field.

# Install Library
Revgrid is shipped via NPM. Use the following commands to install it into an application package:\
`npm i revgrid`

# Install Source
The source can be installed by cloning the repository (or a fork) at: [https://github.com/xilytix/revgrid](https://github.com/xilytix/revgrid)

To build the distribution locally, open a shell at the directory/folder in which Revgrid was cloned and run the following commands:
1. `npm install` or `npm ci` (recommended) to install required dependencies
1. `npm run dist` to generate the distribution (`dist` subfolder). This script will:
    * delete the existing `lib` and `dist` folders
    * compile the TypeScript code
    * generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files (`index.d.ts` and `revgrid-untrimmed.d.ts`)
    * generate source maps

After the distribution has been initially built, it can be rebuilt using `npm run api`. This project uses [TypeScript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) and the `dist` npm script forces a complete build while the `api` script only recompiles the referenced projects which have changed (so it can be a lot faster).

Note that the `lib` subfolder only holds the TypeScript declaration files generated by the compiler. Generally this subfolder can be ignored. It is used during the build process to generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files.

# Test applications

Revgrid has 3 test applications which can be easily built to see it in action:
* **testapp**: Test application for the grid.
* **recordtestapp**: Test application for the Record server set.
* **dratestapp**: Test application which displays static JSON data from a Data Row Array server set and uses a Multi Heading server set to get headings from the property names within the JSON data.

Follow the steps below to build and run these applications:
1. Install the source as described above.
1. Run the respective NPM script (`testapp:serve` or `dratestapp:serve` or `recordtestapp:serve`) to build the test application and start the server.
1. Start the application by opening the following link in your browser:
    http://localhost:3001/

Corresponding NPM scripts also exist in the package file to build the test applications but not run them.

# Building single-file bundles

UMD and ESM single file bundles can be generated for easier consumption without toolchain in-place. To do this, run `npm run bundles`, afterwards find the bundled files under `dist/bundles/`.
Bundles are not built by default and are not included in the NPM package. It is recommended to consume the library through NPM and webpack.

# Public API Interfaces are subject to change
Many aspects of the code base still need to be cleaned up.  As part of this, it is possible that API interfaces and behaviour will change. Also, some features and convenience functions may be removed if they are deemed to not be inline with Revgrid's objectives.

We will endeavour to document these API changes however this will probably only consist of dot points. You may need to examine the Revgrid source code to fully understand the implications of these API changes.
