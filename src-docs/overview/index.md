# Overview

Revgrid focuses on speed.  It has a limited [feature](./features.md) set compared to other JavaScript grids but implements these features reliably in a real-time context.

## Learning

Revgrid has a longer initial learning curve than other grids for getting started.  However once the initial understanding has developed, it has a shorter development time for developing real-time grids.

Probably the best way to learn Revgrid is to:

1. Review the [architecture](../architecture/index.md)
1. Examine some of the [examples](../examples/index.md)
1. Start development and refer to source code
1. Obviously also look for information on the internet

## Install

From [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/revgrid):

`npm install revgrid`
