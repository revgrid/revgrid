# History

This project was developed by a rewriting and combining the following 2 projects:
* Revgrid - a Delphi library written by [Paritech](https://paritech.com)/[Motif Markets](https://motifmarkets.com)
* [Hypergrid](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/) - a JavaScript library. The fork by [Eclipse Trading](https://github.com/EclipseTrading/hypergrid/) was used as part of this rewrite.

The rewrite of Hypergrid involved substantial design changes to improve its resilience and make it compatible the Revgrid code from Motif Markets.  Also the conversion to TypeScript greatly improved the readability of the codebase.
