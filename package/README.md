Revgrid is a canvas based virtual grid focusing on realtime data display and performance. Data is injected into the grid using server interfaces.

Its main features are:

* Speed
* Virtual (supporting display of very large data sets)
* Event driven (low CPU usage)
* Multiple selections (rectangle, row and column)
* Focus
* Smooth horizontal scrolling
* Multiple subgrids (header, main, footer)
* Fixed rows and columns
* Plug in cell painters
* Plug in cell editors
* Plug in UI controllers

Note that it is necessary to create a set of server interfaces in order to display data with Revgrid. The library contains 4 pre-built server interface sets and the test programs also demonstrate how to create server sets.

## Installation
The library can be installed into an application package with the npm command:\
`npm i revgrid`
